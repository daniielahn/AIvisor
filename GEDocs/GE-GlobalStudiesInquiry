GLOBAL STUDIES INQUIRY
Note: Lists of courses in each GE category are provided to give students information on what 
courses may be available. However, the most up-to-date and official information about whether 
or not a course is approved for a GE category is in the course description provided in Campus 
Solutions through the student portal.

The Global Studies Inquiry category requires two courses or six units of credit. Students may 
complete the Global Studies Inquiry category through a Chapman sponsored Study Abroad 
Program offered through the Center for Global Education. A full semester abroad in a Chapman 
program completes this category. Shorter Chapman sponsored travel courses to locations abroad 
fulfill one course or three units of credit for this category. In addition, students have the option 
of selecting any course listed below that allow them to explore the diversity inherent in our 
social and natural environments, including human diversity and world cultures. (The GE code is 
GC, 6 credits.) 

Learning Outcome: Students connect contemporary social and/or environmental topics to their 
origins and analyze their effects on our increasingly globalized world. [Revised spring 2019]
