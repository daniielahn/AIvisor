LANGUAGE INQUIRY
Note: Lists of courses in each GE category are provided to give students information on what 
courses may be available. However, the most up-to-date and official information about whether 
or not a course is approved for a GE category is in the course description provided in Campus 
Solutions through the student portal. 
Students complete part of their general education program in a language other than English so 
that they may lead inquiring, ethical and productive lives as global citizens. This may be 
accomplished by completing a language class at the intermediate or above level (i.e., a language 
acquisition course at the 201 level or a higher-level language course taught in language other 
than English). In today’s world, mastery of a foreign language transcends geography and 
political borders while reinforcing communication and cross-cultural understanding. 
 
LC GE Languages-Student Learning Outcomes (SLO’s):
• Students will understand, speak, read and write the target language at the intermediate or above 
level as defined by the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Language (ACTFL) 
proficiency guidelines. 
• Students will demonstrate an understanding of culture(s) where the target language is spoken 
and will compare similarities and differences across languages and cultures (according to 
National Standards in Foreign Language Education –Known as ‘The Five Cs’).
