Note: Lists of courses in each GE category are provided to give students information on what 
courses may be available. However, the most up-to-date and official information about 
whether or not a course is approved for a GE category is in the course description provided 
in Campus Solutions through the student portal
Provides students an opportunity to engage with the process of scientific investigation and the 
knowledge it produces. (The GE code is NI, 3 – 4 credits) 
Learning Outcome: Students engage in scientific investigation to explore the knowledge 
produced by scientific processes. [revised 2019]
