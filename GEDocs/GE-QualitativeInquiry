QUANTITATIVE INQUIRY
Note: Lists of courses in each GE category are provided to give students information on what 
courses may be available. However, the most up-to-date and official information about whether 
or not a course is approved for a GE category is in the course description provided in Campus 
Solutions through the student portal
Provides students an opportunity to investigate and explore university-level mathematical and/or 
computer science analysis. (The GE code is QI, 3 credits) 
Learning Outcome: Students create sophisticated arguments supported by quantitative evidence 
and can clearly communicate those arguments in a variety of formats (using words, tables, 
graphs, mathematical equations, etc., as appropriate). [Revised spring 2019]
