citations, and source materially logically and dialogically, indicating how forms of evidence 
relate to each other and the author’s position; and compose the text with: a style or styles 
appropriate to the purpose and intended audience, a consistent use of the diction appropriate to 
the author’s topic and purpose, the ability to establish and vary authorial voice(s) and tone(s), a
